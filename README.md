# Bondage College & Bondage Club

[![CI](https://gitgud.io/BondageProjects/Bondage-College/badges/master/pipeline.svg?ignore_skipped=true)](https://gitgud.io/BondageProjects/Bondage-College/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml)

Welcome to the Bondage College!

This project is a Javascript/HTML5 game that contains adult themes such as BDSM.
It's pretty simple and there's no real goal, you play a new student on her first
day in a kinky college. There's lots of things to try and many possible outcomes
so be curious and kinky!

The (aptly-named) `BondageClub` folder is where the code for the Bondage Club
lives; the multiplayer-enabled game that you can join at the end of the Bondage
College storyline. Those are two separate games, but share a repository for
historical reasons.

It's free to download locally but please don't distribute it or publish it without
Ben987's consent.

You can also add content to the game or correct errors if you want, simply fork
the repository, work on it and create a merge request!
